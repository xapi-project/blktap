/* Coverity Scan model
 *
 * This is a modelling file for Coverity Scan. Modelling helps to avoid false
 * positives.
 *
 * - A model file can't import any header files.
 * - Therefore only some built-in primitives like int, char and void are
 *   available but not NULL etc.
 * - Modelling doesn't need full structs and typedefs. Rudimentary structs
 *   and similar types are sufficient.
 * - An uninitialised local pointer is not an error. It signifies that the
 *   variable could be either NULL or have some data.
 *
 * Coverity Scan doesn't pick up modifications automatically. The model file
 * must be uploaded by an admin in the analysis.
 *
 * The Xen Coverity Scan modelling file used the cpython modelling file as a
 * reference to get started (suggested by Coverty Scan themselves as a good
 * example), but all content is Xen specific.
