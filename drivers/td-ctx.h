/**
 * A VBD context: groups two or more VBDs of the same tapdisk.
 *
 * TODO The purpose of this struct is dubious: it allows one or more VBDs
 * belonging to the same tapdisk process to share the same handle to the event
 * channel driver. This means that when an event triggers on some event
 * channel, this notification will be delivered via the file descriptor of the
 * handle. Thus, we need to look which exactly event channel triggered. This
 * functionality is a trade off between reducing the total amount of open
 * handles to the event channel driver versus speeding up the data path. Also,
 * it effectively allows for more event channels to be polled by select. The
 * bottom line is that if we use one VBD per tapdisk this functionality is
 * unnecessary.
